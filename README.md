# Calendar Application

# Project Description
This project is a calendar application that enables users to manage events virtually. The application allows users to create, modify, delete, and view events within a virtual calendar. Notably, the application does not require any persistent storage, storing all data in memory using appropriate data structures.

# Core Features
1. Event Creation:
Users can create events with a title, description, date, and time.

2. Event Modification:
Events can be edited or deleted after their creation.

3. Daily View:
Display all events for a single day using a list or stack to manage daily events.

4. Monthly View:
Utilize a hash table to quickly access events on any given day within a month.

5. Event Conflicts:
Implement an algorithm to detect and warn about event scheduling conflicts.

6. Event Reminders:
Use a priority queue to manage and display upcoming event reminders.
